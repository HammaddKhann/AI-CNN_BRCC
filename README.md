A Real Life Bicep Rep Curl Counter by building a convolutional neural network from scratch. 

### Build my own custom dataset of over 5000 images of a contracted and an extended arm for the classification task. The counter ran in real time counting the number of bicep curls performed. Achieved an accuracy of 61% using the parameters present in the files and 5000 images.
